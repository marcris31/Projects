# CNC Flame Cutting Machine Simulator #

The goal of this project was to develop a CNC (Computer numerical Control) Flame Cutting Machine Simulator, a
software program that reads a file containing a cutting path and generates commands to
simulate the movement of a cutting head along the X and Y axes. The project will offer a
valuable tool for testing and optimizing cutting paths before the actual execution, thus
reducing material wastage and improving cutting accuracy.

More details can be found in the attached documentation.
