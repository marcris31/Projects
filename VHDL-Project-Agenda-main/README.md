# PROGRAMMABLE OFFICE DIARY IN VHDL
The task of this project was to design a programmable office diary that displays:  
• year, month, day: with numbers;  
• day: with letters;  
• hour and minute: with numbers;  
• ambient temperature in degrees Celsius.  
The agenda will also be provided with an audible alarm (simulation) associated with the hour and minute.

I have chosen this project because it seemed interesting and because it has everyday applications. When I have started I realized that it is not that easy as I thought. I tried to use my algorithmic thinking and make everything to look well developed.

More details can be found in the attached documentation.
