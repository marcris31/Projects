# ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ASSIGNMENTS

Here are a few logic puzzles solved using Mace4, a program that searches for finite models of first-order formulas. For a given domain size, all instances of the formulas over the domain are constructed. The result is a set of ground clauses with equality. Then, a decision procedure based on ground equational rewriting is applied.

More information can be found in the attaced documentation.
