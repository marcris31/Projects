# POLYNOMIAL CALCULATOR
The purpose of this object was to design and implement a system for a polynomial calculator. The objective was to have a dedicated graphical interface through which the user can insert polynomials, select mathematical operations to be performed, and view the result. We considered polynomials of one variable and integer coefficients.
