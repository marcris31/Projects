# POLYNOMIAL CALCULATOR
The purpose of this object was to design and implement a system for a polynomial calculator. The objective was to have a dedicated graphical interface through which the user can insert polynomials, select mathematical operations to be performed, and view the result. We considered polynomials of one variable and integer coefficients.

## Conclusions
I learned a lot throughout the project, from brushing up on basic ideas to implementing more complex algorithms necessary to effectively complete the assignment requirements. The project presented some challenges, but it was definitely enjoyable. There is plenty of room for future development, including the addition of features not included in the requirements. For instance, adding a nicer GUI, incorporating new operations, or allowing users to work with more than two polynomials.
